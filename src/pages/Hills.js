                    With two operational airports in the state, Dabolim Airport and MOPA airport, MOPA itself has the potential to double our footfalls‚Äù, Faldessai added. According to him, Goa is expecting more than 1.5 cr footfalls in the coming year, predicting to experience more than whatever achieved in the past. The numbers are coming as the capacity that MOPA airport is bringing, and the kind of linkages that it has formed with various international as well as domestic destinations is phenomenal.
